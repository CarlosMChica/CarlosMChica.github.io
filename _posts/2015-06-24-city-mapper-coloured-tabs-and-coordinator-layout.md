City Mapper is one of the most known transport apps out there, personally I find it the best by far. Lately, they've changed their UI/UX which I find particularly useful and beautiful. 

One of the widgets I like the most on the app are the coloured tabs, especially the colour changing progressively while you swipe left-right on the view pager. So, I decided to play around with it and implement this behaviour along with the new coordinator layout, that was released on the design support library.

I created a <a href="https://github.com/cmc00022/CityMapperTabs" target="_blank">demo</a> project on GitHub to show how to implement the coloured tabs along with using the new coordinator layout.
Enjoy
